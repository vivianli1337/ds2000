BOY AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU
BUSINESS IS BOOMING
BY THE SKIN OF MY TEETH
MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE
CAN I TAKE YOUR ORDER
CHEW WITH YOUR MOUTH CLOSED
COULD I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU
DO I HAVE A CHOICE
DO YOU CATCH MY DRIFT
DO YOU TAKE CREDIT CARDS
DON'T BLINK YOU MIGHT MISS SOMETHING
DON'T BREATH A WORD OF THIS TO ANYONE
DON'T FORGET TO SET YOUR CLOCK AHEAD ONE HOUR
DON'T GIVE IT ANOTHER THOUGHT
DON'T GIVE UP
DON'T HESITATE TO ASK
DON'T MAKE A MOUNTAIN OUT OF A MOLEHILL
DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB
DON'T ROCK THE BOAT
DON'T STAND A GHOST OF A CHANCE

GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON
GIVE ME SOME TIME TO THINK IT OVER
GIVE THEM A DOSE OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE
GO ASK YOUR FATHER
GO THROUGH IT WITH A FINE-TOOTH COMB
GUARANTEED OR YOUR MONEY BACK
GUESS WHO CALLED ME TODAY
HANG IN THERE
HAVE WE MET BEFORE
HE FELL FLAT ON HIS FACE
HE GAVE US A BLOW-BY-BLOW ACCOUNT
HE WHO LAUGHS LAST LAUGHS BEST
HE'S GOT A GOOD HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS
HE'S GOT NERVES OF STEEL
HERE'S TO YOUR HEALTH
HEY WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA
HOW CAN I BE OF ASSISTANCE
HOW DOES HE DO IT
HOW MAY I DIRECT YOUR CALL
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR STEAK COOKED
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU
I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN
I COULDN'T RESIST
I CRINGE EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT IT
I FEEL LIKE I'M WALKING ON AIR
I FEEL LIKE I'VE KNOWN YOU ALL MY LIFE
I FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY
I GIVE IT A THUMBS UP
I GIVE YOU ALL THE CREDIT IN THE WORLD
I GOT A KICK OUT OF IT
I GOT IT STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH
I HATE TO SAY I TOLD YOU SO BUT I TOLD YOU SO
I HAVE A DATE WITH DESTINY
I JUST ABOUT DIED LAUGHING
I JUST HAD A THOUGHT
I KNOW IT LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND
I LIKE YOUR STYLE
I MISJUDGED YOU
I MUST BE DREAMING
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THE DAY
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY
I READ YOU LOUD AND CLEAR
I TAKE BACK EVERYTHING I SAID
I THINK YOU'LL BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED
I WANT TO BE PERFECTLY CLEAR
I WANT TO BE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE
I WAS GOING BANANAS
I WAS IN TOTAL SHOCK
I WAS JUST MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS
I WAS ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT
I WAS SCARED OUT OF MY WITS
I WAS TEARING MY HAIR OUT
I WOULD BE DELIGHTED
I WOULD BET MY LIFE ON IT
I WOULD STAKE MY REPUTATION ON IT
I WOULDN'T BET ON IT
I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT
I WOULDN'T TAKE IT TOO SERIOUSLY
I'D SWEAR ON A STACK OF BIBLES
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT
I'LL GIVE IT A TRY
I'LL GIVE YOU THREE GUESSES
I'LL HAVE WHAT SHE'S HAVING
I'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR YOU
I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU
I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF IT
I'LL START MY DIET TOMORROW
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT
I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT
I'M A PRETTY GOOD JUDGE OF CHARACTER
I'M ASHAMED OF MYSELF
I'M DRAWING A BLANK
I'M FEELING A LITTLE LIGHT-HEADED
I'M GENUINELY TOUCHED
I'M GETTING AHEAD OF MYSELF
I'M GOING TO BEAT THEM AT THEIR OWN GAME
I'M HAPPY AS A CLAM
I'M HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE
I'M HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE
I'M IN OVER MY HEAD
I'M JUST A BUNDLE OF NERVES
I'M NOT A MIND READER
I'M NOT LISTENING
I'M NUTS ABOUT IT
I'M PROUD OF YOU
I'M READY WHENEVER YOU ARE
I'M SORRY I ASKED
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT
I'M SURE EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT FOR THE BEST
I'M SURE THERE'S A LOGICAL EXPLANATION
I'M TELLING MOM
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU
I'VE BEEN KEEPING MYSELF BUSY
I'VE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE
I'VE GOT THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL
I'VE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING
IF I CHANGE MY MIND YOU'LL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION
IF THE WALLS HAD EARS
IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM JOIN 'EM
IS IT ME OR IS IT COLD IN HERE
IT FITS LIKE A GLOVE
IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME
IT NEVER EVEN CROSSED MY MIND
IT NEVER HURTS TO ASK
IT PROMISES TO BE QUITE AN EVENT
IT WAS A REAL CROWD PLEASER
IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
IT WAS TOTALLY AWESOME
IT WAS WELL WORTH WAITING FOR
IT WASN'T MY IDEA
IT WENT LIKE CLOCKWORK
IT'S A MATTER OF PRINCIPAL
IT'S A REAL PAGE TURNER
IT'S A WHOLE NEW BALL GAME
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE SERVING YOU
IT'S DRIVING ME UP THE WALL
IT'S JUST A STONE'S THROW AWAY
IT'S NO TROUBLE AT ALL
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAY IT'S HOW YOU SAY IT
IT'S NOTHING LIKE I IMAGINED
IT'S ONLY A HOP SKIP AND A JUMP AWAY
IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION
IT'S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
LAST ONE THERE'S A ROTTEN EGG
LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT
LET ME HELP YOU WITH THAT
LET THEM LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES
LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS
LET'S GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS
LET'S MAKE IT AN EVEN DOZEN
LET'S SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT
LET'S SETTLE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL
LET'S TAKE IT ONE STEP AT A TIME
LIFE IS FULL OF SURPRISES
LIVE A LITTLE
LOOK BOTH WAYS BEFORE CROSSING THE STREET
MAY I TAKE YOUR ORDER
MEMBERS ONLY
MORE POWER TO YOU
MY HEART BLEEDS FOR YOU
MY MIND IS MADE UP
NO ARTIFICIAL INGREDIENTS
NO HARM NO FOUL
NO MONEY DOWN
NO OFFENSE TAKEN
NO REASONABLE OFFER REFUSED
NOT IN A MILLION YEARS
NOW THAT'S A GREAT IDEA
NOW THAT'S MORE LIKE IT
NOW THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO SEE
NOW WHERE WAS I
NOW WHERE WERE WE
NOW'S THE PERFECT TIME
ONE FOR THE RECORD BOOKS
OPERATORS ARE STANDING BY TO TAKE YOUR ORDER
PARKING BY PERMIT ONLY
PLAYING FOR HIGH STAKES
PLEASE HOLD WHILE I TRANSFER YOUR CALL
PLEASE STAY TUNED FOR YOUR LOCAL NEWS
POINT ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
PULL UP A CHAIR
PUT A LITTLE EFFORT INTO IT
READ ALL DIRECTIONS BEFORE ASSEMBLING
RECOMMENDED BY DENTISTS
SATISFACTION GUARANTEED OR YOUR MONEY BACK
SAVING THE BEST FOR LAST
SAVING UP FOR A RAINY DAY
SEE YOU LATER ALLIGATOR
SHAPE UP OR SHIP OUT
SHE HAS IMPECCABLE TASTE
SHE WAS TALKING A MILE A MINUTE
SHE'S A REAL CHARACTER
SHE'S SO PERKY
SHOWN BY APPOINTMENT ONLY
SIX OF ONE AND HALF A DOZEN OF THE OTHER
SO WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU
SOME THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT UNSAID
SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
SORRY I'M LATE
SORRY WE'RE CLOSED
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN
SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE
SPEAKING OF THE DEVIL
STAY TUNED FOR A VERY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
SUCCESS HASN'T SPOILED YOU YET
SWING YOUR PARTNER 'ROUND AND 'ROUND
TAKE A NUMBER
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT
TELL ME ABOUT IT
TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T ALREADY KNOW
THAT RINGS A BELL
THAT'S THE ICING ON THE CAKE
THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE BEAST
THAT'S THE WAY THE BALL BOUNCES
THE DOCTOR WILL SEE YOU NOW
THEY  WERE HANGING ON HIS EVERY WORD
THEY HAVE AN EXCELLENT TRACK RECORD
THIS IS THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE
TRY IT YOU MIGHT LIKE IT
TWIST MY ARM
UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN
WAS IT SOMETHING I SAID
WASTE NOT WANT NOT
WE GUARANTEE THE LOWEST PRICE
WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON
WE SHOULD DO THIS MORE OFTEN
WE'LL CROSS THAT BRIDGE WHEN WE COME TO IT
WE'RE GAINING MOMENTUM
WE'RE LIKE TWO PEAS IN A POD
WELL IT'S ABOUT TIME
WHAT A GUTSY MOVE
WHAT IT NEEDS IS A WOMAN'S TOUCH
WILL THAT BE CASH OR CHARGE
WOULD YOU LIKE SOUP OR SALAD
YES WE'RE OPEN
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT
YOU CAN DISH IT OUT BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE IT
YOU CAN IMAGINE MY SURPRISE
YOU CAN'T FIGHT CITY HALL
YOU CAN'T WIN THEM ALL
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME TWICE
YOU DON'T MISS A TRICK
YOU HAVE MY WORD ON IT
YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD
YOU MUST BE PRESENT TO WIN
YOU PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS
YOU READ MY MIND
YOU REMIND ME OF SOMEBODY
YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING REALLY FUNNY
YOU WERE SAYING
YOU'RE ENTITLED TO YOUR OPINION
YOU'RE GETTING WARMER
YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT BALLPARK
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK
