    HW5 starter code
    
    Your job is to fill in the details of the four functions at the top.
    
    Make sure you fllow the specs as written, and then when
    you run the code it'll tell you some stuff about T ridership
    and make a couple of plots.
    
    Please do not modify any code outside of those four functions!
    
    
    test case: PASSED

      		            ["red", "time_period_01", "2", "4"],
           	            ["green", "time_period_02", "8", "1"]],
